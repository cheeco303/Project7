Heart Disease Prediction - POWER BI

Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains information on several health and demographic factors, including BMI, smoking
habits, alcohol consumption, physical and mental health, age, sex, race, and whether the individual
has been diagnosed with heart disease.
Tasks:
• Visualize Heart Disease Distribution:
Create a visualization that shows the distribution of individuals with and without heart disease.
Highlight the proportion of heart disease cases across different age categories, genders, and races.
• Analyze Health Habits:
Visualize the correlation between lifestyle habits (e.g., smoking, alcohol consumption, physical
activity) and heart disease.
Create a chart to show the percentage of smokers and non-smokers who have heart disease, along
with similar charts for alcohol consumption and physical activity.
• Study Physical and Mental Health Impact:
Analyze the relationship between physical health and heart disease by visualizing the average
physical health score for individuals with and without heart disease.
Create a visualization that compares mental health scores with the likelihood of heart disease.
• Examine Key Health Indicators:
Create a dashboard visualizing key indicators such as BMI, sleep time, and diabetic status,
highlighting how they relate to the presence of heart disease.
Explore whether there are any patterns in BMI and sleep time that might suggest a higher risk of
heart disease.
Conclusions and Insights:
Based on your visualizations, identify key insights into the factors that contribute to heart disease.
Suggest potential health measures or recommendations for reducing the risk of heart disease based
on your analysis.
Deliverables:
A Power BI dashboard with all the required visualizations.
A brief report summarizing your findings and explaining the insights gained from the dashboard.
